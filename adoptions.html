          <p class="lead">
            Our Annie Bess came to C.A.R.E from a high-kill animal facility in West Virginia.  She was on a euthanasia list until the
            compassionate people at C.A.R.E rescued her.  From our first meeting with her, we knew we had found the perfect dog for our
            family.  She brings such joy to our household!
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            She is loving, silly, loyal, and usually obedient.  Although she has anxiety issues probably stemming from a difficult early
            life, we feel fortunate to be able to help her overcome these issues by providing the best care we can.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            C.A.R.E’s high standards in rehoming dogs is one example of how much they value the dogs they rescue.  We don’t know much
            about the early life of Annie Bess, but we do know she was loved, valued and received excellent care while at C.A.R.E.
            We will always be grateful to the wonderful volunteers of C.A.R.E for allowing us to adopt our Annie Bess.

          <p class="lead">
            PeeWee came into my life when I first saw her picture on Petfinder in late May 2012 and became part of my family
            on June 15, 2012. Those first three months afterwards as she was adjusting were exhausting! It was fast and furious
            to both her and me.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I took PeeWee to the vet in the second month, and she had several teeth removed to fix her bite. Several challenges
            faced PeeWee as she continued adjusting to her new home. As the end of the third month was closing in, I became frustrated
            with PeeWee's transition. My boyfriend encouraged me to consider what she has been through before C.A.R.E rescued her and
            to give her time. Everyone adjusts at their own pace.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Almost overnight, PeeWee began to relax and let us connect. She is quite a barker, a great guard dog both day and night.
            She sleeps right next to me in bed! When I go on vacation, my dog walker takes both my hound dog and PeeWee to her home
            where PeeWee engages with her pack of dog pals. And let no squirrel or chipmunk venture into my yard--PeeWee chases them down
            and out of the yard. We have come so far from our beginning and have a true family!

          <p class="lead">
            I’d been volunteering for C.A.R.E for only a short time and had no plans to foster, but then I saw a picture of this
            teeny, 2-pound Chihuahua.  Vicki was pleading for a foster because there’d been a parvo outbreak at the kennel, and she
            couldn’t take her there. I wasn’t a Chihuahua person AT ALL, but something about that little face...
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            The ladies in Dr. Ware’s office could tell right off the bat how smitten my husband was.  He was swearing up and
            down that we weren’t going to keep her, but they were taking bets on how long it would be before the adoption was final!
            I knew we were in trouble when it was time for her spay surgery. Both of us had tears in our eyes when Vicki and Dan drove
            off with our Lulabelle. She’s now the queen in our house.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            She is definitely my husband’s dog. To hear this grumpy, grouchy, crotchety man cooing, talking baby talk, and carrying this
            little dog everywhere is hilarious!  She eats her breakfast in the middle of our bed and her dinner in his lap every day.
            She’s SO spoiled, but she’s OUR spoiled girl, and we wouldn’t have it any other way because we love her to death.
            Thank you C.A.R.E!

            It was my lucky day when I went in to Petco and met my soon to be "baby" for the first time! I had a completely
            wonderful experience adopting Oliver from C.A.R.E. It is evident that every volunteer truly cares about the dogs
            and is committed to finding them the best possible home.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I can not imagine my life without Oliver as he brings me so much happiness! It has been amazing to watch Oliver grow
            over the past year. I love following C.A.R.E's work and seeing all of the great things they do for the dogs that come
            into their rescue. The best decision of my life was the day I decided to adopt!

          <p class="lead">
            I found C.A.R.E through a listing on Petfinder. At the adoption stand at Petco, we introduced our existing dog, Mimi,
            to the five small dogs on our list. They were not quite right for her, but then we saw Charlotte sitting quietly in
            her crate.  We walked Charlotte and Mimi together, and they seemed like a perfect fit.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            When Charlotte arrived, she didn't want to get out of her crate. We brought Mimi out to greet her, and Charlotte came
            out and was ready to play. They have been best friends ever since. Everyone who adopts needs to give their new pet
            enough time to get used to their new home. Always remember - exercise, obedience, and love. This makes for a happy
            puppy and a happy owner.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Vicki Powell and the people at C.A.R.E are angels. They work tirelessly to re-home all rescued dogs, and some of the
            situations the dogs come from are quite challenging. I recommend CARE to anyone looking for a new dog.

            I have been gone for a year whenever I am away from him for more than an hour.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            He loves to fetch, and catching a ball in mid-air is his favorite thing. He brings my shoes to me in
            the morning, and loves to tease by playing keep away with the dishtowel. Our next-door neighbor’s
            puppy comes over every day, and the two of them play for hours on end. He and our pet Cockatoo
            get along well, too.

          <p class="lead">
            It was a complete change for us to switch to a Terrier breed, but we haven’t regretted it for a moment.
            He is fun loving, affectionate, intelligent, and thoroughly charming.  He is our second rescue dog, and
            I will say that rescue dogs make the best pets. Find a way to open your home to the right rescue dog,
            and you will know the contentment a loving pet can bring.

            I live in Hampton Roads, and I reached out to C.A.R.E. to discuss how I could meet Ranger before coming to Richmond for
            the adoption stand.  I talked to Vicki Powell at length about his skin irritations, dry eye syndrome and partial vision
            loss. She arranged for me to meet a volunteer traveling to the area the next day.  I fell in love and brought him home
            soon afterwards!
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            He settled in with us extremely quickly and has been the perfect addition to my family. He and my twelve-year-old
            Shih Tzu, Buddy, get along well. Ranger also gets along with the children wonderfully.  He even joined Buddy and
            my three birds on a visit to a preschool for a Pet Day presentation. His skin irritations and dry eyes improved, as well!
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Throughout it all, the volunteers at C.A.R.E. were helpful and willing to help with the transition.  In the
            conversations I have had with several of the volunteers, I have come to believe that they are truly doing this to help
            the dogs.  They want nothing more than to find happy homes for the dogs they rescue.

            I knew she was meant to be mine.  My husband, however, was a little nervous about having a
            "special needs" dog. Gracie had a shattered leg when C.A.R.E rescued her, and the leg had to be amputated.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            He quickly realized, though, that someone forgot to tell Gracie that she is "special needs".  On our vet's
            recommendation, we took her on frequent walks to build up the muscles that support her joints.  Now,
            she is a favorite in our neighborhood, as everyone adores the smiling, three-legged dog who so clearly loves life.
            Next up for Gracie: agility training.  Who says you need four legs to do agility???
