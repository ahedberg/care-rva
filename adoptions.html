            I saw Garrett and Barrett online and just had to see them in person. I contacted Vicki, who set up a meeting for me to
            get acquainted with the puppies. They were adorable, lively, and full of joy. I selected Garrett as my new companion.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Vicki kept me informed during the adoption process. She explained things about the process that I never knew, and it
            all made sense. Before I knew it, I was approved and ready to set the pick up date.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Garrett, who is now known as Gambit, is a character and my best friend. Gambit is loyal, loving and my mini shadow.
            He's alert, smart, and has a lot of good energy. I wouldn't change a thing. He's a lot of fun and comforting.
            When I'm feeling down or tired, he picks up on it and cheers me up. His personality is unique, and he loves everyone
            he meets. After looking and searching for months, he was the right choice!!!!

          <p class="lead">
            I fell in love with Gracie's sweet face the first time I saw her, and I could not wait to meet her.  Upon meeting,
            I knew she was meant to be mine.  My husband, however, was a little nervous about having a
            "special needs" dog. Gracie had a shattered leg when C.A.R.E rescued her, and the leg had to be amputated.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            He quickly realized, though, that someone forgot to tell Gracie that she is "special needs".  On our vet's
            recommendation, we took her on frequent walks to build up the muscles that support her joints.  Now,
            she is a favorite in our neighborhood, as everyone adores the smiling, three-legged dog who so clearly loves life.
            Next up for Gracie: agility training.  Who says you need four legs to do agility???
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I will be forever grateful to C.A.R.E for seeing the love in this sweet girl's face, and for giving me the chance to adopt her.

          <p class="lead">
            C.A.R.E gave us the greatest gift by saving Rico (formerly Chauncey) from a high-kill shelter in West Virginia.
            The moment I met him, I knew he was meant to be a member of our family. He has brought us nothing but joy.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            He is quite the quirky little guy, from his underbite, to sitting on windowsills like a cat, to burrowing himself
            into any blanket (or clothing) he can find. He is constantly making us laugh and I can't believe we ever lived without
            him.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            If not for C.A.R.E, we wouldn't have met our doggie-soulmate. The work they do is unmatched! We are so thankful for
            C.A.R.E giving us the opportunity to welcome home the newest (and furriest) member of our family.

          <p class="lead">
            We adopted Tiffany from a C.A.R.E event at Petco.  I originally went there to meet another dog,
            but as I walked through the plethora of dogs available for adoption, Tiffany caught my eye.  I
            walked over to her, and right away she came to the crate door to be petted!</p>
          <p class="lead">
            I knew she was the perfect one for us.  My husband said he has never had a small dog to sit with him and watch TV.
            Boy, has that changed!  She is a very important part of our life: our camping companion, our boating companion,
            and our other dog Max's best friend.
